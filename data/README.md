This is the de-identified dataset received from Sarah Almond on September 16, 2019, and subsequently processed by Nabarun Dasgupta using the Stata code DixLedgerDataCleaning.do

This [quick tutotiral](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) will allow you to remotely retrieve the latest version of the CSV in a command line software. But I couldn't figure out exactly how to make it work within Stata (or Python), so you can just download the CSV or .dta files in this directory. :)
I'm also posting the data cleaning code in this directory so it is all in one place.
